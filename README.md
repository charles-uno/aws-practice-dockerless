# Full Stack Amulet Model - Django

It's all in Python for legibility and fewer requirements. Performance is not really a consideration



## Sanity Check

To run the amulet model on its own, without worrying about Django:
```
python3 -m amulet_flashcards.api.amulet_model
```



## Requirements

- django
- pyyaml
- pytest
- typing_extensions
- django-cors-headers


htmx. you can import it as a script but better practice is to download it and host it locally
