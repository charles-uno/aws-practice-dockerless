# Full Stack Amulet Model - Django

It's all in Python for legibility and fewer requirements. Performance is not really a consideration


To run the model locally and spit out a formatted summary (without launching the Django server):
```
python3 -m amulet_backend.api.amulet_model
```



## Requirements

- django
- pyyaml
- pytest
- typing_extensions
