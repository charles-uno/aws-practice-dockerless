# Full Stack Amulet Model - Django

It's all in Python for legibility and fewer requirements. Performance is not really a consideration

## Sanity Check

To run the amulet model on its own, without worrying about Django:
```
python3 -m amulet_flashcards.api.amulet_model
```


## Docker and Requirements

```
make build
```

or 

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


## To Do

- support for activating expedition map
- HTTPS
- License
- Deploy to AWS via GitHub Actions
- Write up a post about it
